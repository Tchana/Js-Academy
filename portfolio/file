            <p id="p1"> I studied html on my own, believing it could be a start. This helped me in my further researchs such 
              as javascript. I have had help from some community leads who provided me with some videos and books 
              that guided me all along.

              <p id="p2">I studied CSS from beginning to end but as soon as i was done, i heard about css3 which is much 
                more interesting. It is more of complicated than the actual css but always more amazing.

                javascript is another work in progress. Difficult to understand but as soon as you understand, it 
                becomes very addictive. I'm as well eager to work on javascript projects.
