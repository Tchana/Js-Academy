         I studied html on my own, believing it could be a start. This helped me in my further researchs such 
        as javascript. I have had help from some community leads who provided me with some videos and books 
        that guided me all along.

              I studied CSS from beginning to end but as soon as i was done, i heard about 
              css3 which is much 
              more interesting. It is more of complicated than the actual css but 
              always more amazing.

                javascript is another work in progress. Difficult to understand but as soon as you understand, it 
                becomes very addictive. I'm as well eager to work on javascript projects.
